               <b> I'm  Mohammad Haolader.</b> <br/> Currently studying Computer Science at
                Stamford University Bangladesh. I have been working as a
                freelance web developer and writer for the last two years.The
                world is changing rapidly, and I donâ€™t have enough professional
                experience to be certain about such things. However, I know that
                I can provide a fresh take and an extraordinary approach to
                every project.
